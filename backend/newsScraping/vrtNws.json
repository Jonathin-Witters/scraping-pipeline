During a major check on two-wheel traffic half of all drivers checked, were found to be in violation in some way or other. People on mopeds and bikes were either speeding, had no lights or were ignoring traffic signs. One moped was even able to do 116 kilometres per hour on a test bench.", "thumbnail": "https://images.vrt.be/vrtnws_web/2025/11/13/4f310431-be0a-4428-bb4e-3b944aee2e5f.jpg?width=200&height=113&q=80&blur=90", "tags": ["West Flanders"], "content": ["‘The checks were focused on mopeds, fat bikes, e-scooters, speed pedelecs and regular bicycles. But motorists who committed offences were also pulled over,’ explains Lien Depoorter of the Bruges police.", "‘We checked 156 drivers. Half of them were fine and received a gadget from our prevention team. The other half were caught committing all kinds of offences, connected to lighting, position on the road, ignoring traffic signs or traffic lights.’", "The police were also on the lookout for souped-up mopeds. In Bruges they used a new test bench for the first time. It allows the speed of different types of vehicles to be measured, including fat bikes and e-scooters. ‘One moped reached a speed of 116 kilometres per hour on the test bench. That moped was confiscated and also declared forfeited. This means that the owner will never get their moped back,’ explains Depoorter. ", "\"A total of 15 souped-up mopeds were confiscated, 12 people were fined for ignoring traffic signs, 11 for using a smartphone while cycling or riding a scooter, and 48 for not having bicycle lights. Cyclists not holding their handlebars were also fined. 23 motorists were fined for overtaking a cyclist in a bicycle zone. The Bruges bicycle zone was expanded significantly last 1 October.", "‘We have noticed that many people are still breaking the rules, despite intensive prevention campaigns. Such large-scale checks remain necessary, in addition to daily detection efforts,’ concludes Depoorter."]},

Many drivers underestimate the risks of speeding, which is one of the main causes of road accidents.", "The speed enforcement campaign is organised twice a year, in spring and autumn. During the last edition in April, a record number of vehicles were checked: 1.339 million vehicles in only 24 hours. Almost 4 per cent of the vehicles checked were speeding. 1.69 per cent were caught by a fixed camera, while mobile speed cameras detected more than 8 per cent of offences.", "The results prove that speeding is still ingrained in the driving behaviour of the people of Belgium. According to the federal police, it is absolutely necessary to continue monitoring and raising awareness. Road safety remains a priority for Belgium’s integrated police force."]},

However, the lessons learned from Ukraine also show that it is important to have the latest technology in both drone and counter-drone capacity.", "Assistance from our neighbouring countries, the UK, Germany and France, in the fight against the drone threat was ‘very welcome’, the general noted, but he was unwilling to comment further.", "Vansina also stressed that Russia has completely switched to a war economy, with tanks, guns and ships rolling off the production line on a daily basis.", "‘The question is what will happen if there is a ceasefire in Ukraine tomorrow.’ Meanwhile, China is not standing still either and is developing its armed forces and arsenal at an enormous speed.", "Vansina expressed concern about this and asked politicians to consider the way in which purchases are made in Belgium.", "‘We work using peacetime procedures, with all kinds of intermediate steps and rules, which slow down the procurement process, while our opponents move much faster,’ he noted.", "‘I don't know if we in the West can continue using our peacetime rules.
